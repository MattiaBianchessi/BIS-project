## Introduction
This project (paper) aims to present an analysis of business processes using Process Mining techniques. This project aims to exploit process mining techniques to find some optimizations for the management of processes involving traffic tickets. The first chapters present the log and describe some cleaning and filtering operations to keep the data meaningful for the purpose of analysis. Then the log is analyzed through statistical methods to find areas for improvement, analyzed variants. Finally, business objectives to improve business efficiency are presented.

## Method
The method here used is The Knowledge Uplift Trail (KUT) that turn raw data into useful insights. The method consist of in a series of steps that eventually provide a clearer understanding of the data in the dataset. The technique used are:


  * Data cleaning: prepare the event log make it more human readeable, i.e. filling missing value, standardizing some column, and some convertions.
  * Data filtering: cut out some invalid cases, filter out the noise to keep the relevant information.
  * Descriptive analysis: here  it uses some statistical features to analyse some characteristics.
  * Process mining: use process mining techniques to discover the process.
  * Conformance checking: identifies any deviations from the typical sequence of event.
  * Intervention strategies: are designed based on the insights from the previous steps and they are continuously improved through monitoring and measurement.
